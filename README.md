# LC-3 VM

A VM for emulating the [LC3 computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC-3). Ideally, it will run any LC-3 assembly program.

There is both a C and a C++ version with their own implementation strategies:

**C** - This version focusess on readablity. If you want to learn how the LC-3 works this is the one to use.

**CPP** - The goal of this one is minimalism. It uses a unique technique to generate instructions at compile time. This method is thanks to [Bisqwit](https://github.com/bisqwit) and his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIUVSD3yqqE) on NES emulation.
